# Svelte Remote Functions

Svelte recently announced a [proposal for remote functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897) that's meant to be an alternative to SvelteKit `load` functions for component-level data loading.

This repo includes:

- [Asynchronous Svelte PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15844) and the [SvelteKit Remote Functions PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13957)
